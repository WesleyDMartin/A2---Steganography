## Recover lost image from an old camera file

# The Task
I was tasked with recovering up to 30 lost images off of an older (circa 2000-2001) HP digital camera. This project was a chance to 
work on some digital forensics skills, and was an excellent chance to learn about file formatting and disk analysis.
